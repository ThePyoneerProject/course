# Who Is It For?
---
My approach is for people who prefer the high risk / high reward path, and who are able to tolerate the stress that comes with it.

It's for self-driven individuals who are ready to take an alternative, more entrepreneur-ish journey towards web develompent, and who are not afraid of getting out there and being proactive. 

It's designed for people with a realistic understanding of the commitment required to excel in the tech world. 

It's for those who receive the **blessing** of developing a **passion** for programming (you just know it).

On the other hand, this project is **definitely not suitable** for those who lack self-motivation, are not tech-savvy, and are looking for quick results or shortcuts to success.

There's no easy way.
