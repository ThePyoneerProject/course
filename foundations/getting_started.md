I don't want to waste your time, or mine, building lower quality versions of already existing content.

Thus, I invite you to go ahead and start The Odin Project's [**Foundations Course**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), which will teach you everything you need to know to start getting into full-stack development.

Expect frustration, as it's fairly challenging.

I'm diligently working to create an outstanding **Full Stack Python** option for you as a new choice once you reach the [Choosing Your Path Forward](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-choose-your-path-forward) lesson.
