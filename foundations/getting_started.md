# Getting Started
---
I don't want to waste your time, or mine, building lower quality versions of already existing content.

Thus, I invite you to go ahead and start The Odin Project's [**Foundations Course**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), which will teach you everything you need to know to start getting into full-stack development.

Expect frustration, as it's fairly challenging.

Meanwhile, I'll diligently work on preparing the best version that I can to provide you with a new choice for [Choosing Your Path Forward](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-choose-your-path-forward) - **Full Stack Python**.
